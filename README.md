# Health-Metrics-Impact-A-Data-Visualization-Approach
## Project Motivation
The project aims to analyze and understand the impact of health behaviors on the socio-economic outcomes of American high school students. By examining early-life health habits, the project aimed to uncover risk factors and support the development of targeted policies to enhance student well-being and future productivity.
## Methodology
- **Data Source:** CDCâ€™s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) dataset was utilized for comprehensive health and behavior data.
- **Data Cleaning and Analysis:** In order to process data for analysis and visualization, the following set of data cleaning steps were applied: handling of missing data through imputation, BMI classification into categories (underweight, normal, overweight), data transformation to a long format to facilitate pivot table creation, categorical encoding and data aggregation. 
- **Health Index Creation:** The Health Index was developed by aggregating relevant health metrics, normalizing them for comparability, applying weights according to their significance, and combining these weighted metrics using a formula to generate a comprehensive measure of overall health status.

### Visualization: 
The analysis was further broken down in terms of daily routines, nutritional habits, and engagement in risky behaviors.
In order to elucidate the connections between healh metrics and different socio-economic impacts, seaborn and matplotlib was used to create different visualiations.
